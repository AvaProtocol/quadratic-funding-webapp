```

# Stack We Have Used

1. Lerna (A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. https://lernajs.io)
2. Yarn Workspace
3. React Js and Next Js
4. Gatsby Js
5. Styled System and Styled Components
6. Firebase Deployment.
7. Vercel Deployment.

# Development

Follow the below procedure to go with the development process.

## GatsbyJs

If you want to develop only for gatsbyjs then you don't need the `/landing` folder which contains only nextjs related code. You can delete `/landing` folder.

For any specific template like the template under `/app` route. If you want to use this template only, then you have to follow below procedure.

1. Go to `/landing-gatsby/src/pages/`
2. now copy all the content from `app.js`
3. Paste all the content in `/landing-gatsby/src/pages/index.js`

Now for cleaning the unused code in your project follow the below procedure.

1. Now you can delete all other pages except `404.js`. That mean in your `/pages` folder you will have two files `index.js` and `404.js`
2. From `/landing-gatsby/src/containers/` folder you can delete all other folder except `App` and `Error`
3. From `/common/assets/image/` folder you can delete all other folder except `app`. Do not delete any files from there like `404.svg`, `error.svg` etc.
4. From `/common/data/` folder you can delete all other folder except `App`.
5. From `/common/theme/` folder you can delete all other folder except `app`. Do not delete the `index.js` file.

Now if you start your `gatsbyjs` server with `yarn gatsby-dev` then you will get your server running on `localhost:8000`

## NextJs

If you want to develop only for `nextjs` then then you don't need the `/landing-gatsby` folder. You can delete the folder.

For any specific template like the template under `/app` route. If you want to use this template only, then you have to follow below procedure.

1. Go to `/landing/pages/`
2. now copy all the content from `app.js`
3. Paste all the content in `/landing/pages/index.js`

Now for cleaning the unused code in your project follow the below procedure.

1. Now you can delete all other pages except `_app.js`, `_documents.js` and `_error.js`. That mean in your `/pages` folder you will have four files `index.js`, `_app.js`, `_documents.js` and `error.js`
2. From `/landing/containers/` folder you can delete all other folder except `App` and `Error`
3. From `/common/assets/image/` folder you can delete all other folder except `app`. Do not delete any files from there like `404.svg`, `error.svg` etc.
4. From `/common/data/` folder you can delete all other folder except `App`.
5. From `/common/theme/` folder you can delete all other folder except `app`. Do not delete the `index.js` file.

To start the server for `nextjs` you have to run `yarn nextjs-dev` and the server will start on `locahost:3000`.

# Explaining Containers

In the `containers` directory you will get folder for our every template. If you want to use App template. Then in the `App` directory you will get folders containing different section of the template like `Banner`, `Footer`, `Testimonial`, `Navbar` etc.

All of these containers contains regular reactjs code.

# Deployment
